# progdic's improvements board
A list of projects idea for improving the server.
Each of these has been suggested as an improvement to the server.
Feel free to pick one if you're looking for something to work on.

Yes, we could use a preexisting solution, and you probably should do that in
a work environment. However, this is a learning community. Community members
rolling our own tools and all of us dogfooding them together creates great
opportunities for members' growth. 

## Stats bot
RIP StabbyStats <3

A bot that tracks activity on the server, preferably by user and by channel.
There's also interesting opportunities for charting here.

## News bot
A bot that follows news sources and posts them in a hypothetical #news channel.
We did try this once, but the project was discontinued.
